# Time Series Analysis with Python and Prophet

## Description

- Time Series Analysis to indentify unsual patterns
- Use of Heat Maps to identify relationships in search for days of the week and hours
- Relationship between search trends and stock prices


## Technologies

This example uses the following technologies:

- **Jupyter** - Jupyter is a web-based interactive development environment for data science and analysis. Please see [Jupyter documentation](https://jupyter.org/) for more information.
- **pandas** - pandas is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis. Please see [pandas documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/) for more information.
- **Scikit-Learn** - Scikit-Learn is an open-source machine learning library for the Python programming language.  Please see [Scikit-Learn documentation](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/scikit_learn/scikit_learn_introduction.htm) for more information.
- **Prophet** - Prophet is an open-source library for time-series forecasting that was developed by Facebook.   Please see [Prophet documentation] (https://facebook.github.io/prophet/) for more information.
